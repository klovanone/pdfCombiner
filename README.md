# PDF COMBINER

** made some changes to this utility so that it works on Windows and other platforms **

A simple script to merge a bunch of PDF files into one.

Given a directory, this program will find all of the PDF files in that
directory and combine them into one PDF file.

If no arguments are given to the command, then it finds all PDF files in the
current directory and combines them into one PDF file.

If no name is given, then it combines all PDFs into a file name MergedFile.pdf
